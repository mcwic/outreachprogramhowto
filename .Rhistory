## Do you want to start an after school computing program at your school?
1. Read these slides
2. Find students
3. Get started
4. Have fun!
--- .class #id
## What you need
1. Yourself or another "mentor"
2. Students
3. Space
4. Computers (if you do not have access to computers but would like to teach your students computational thinking, check out <a href="http://csunplugged.org"> CS Unplugged</a>).
5. A plan (provided here)
## Week 1 - Scratch & Introductions
This week, start by introducing yourself and the field of computer science.
Then, get your students excited about programming by getting them started with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch programming</a>.
## Week 1 - Introductions (Role Modeling)
Introduce yourself. If you are a computer scientist, tell students how you got into computer science, why you like it, and a little bit about your other interests.
TIPS:
1. Avoid stating that you were "good" at math and science. (Girls often feel that their abilities are implicit rather than something they can gain with through practice. NCWIT case study: ).
2. Try to provide relatable interests (ice skating, soccer, etc.) so that the girls can see themselves in your shoes one day.
3. If possible, try to describe multiple paths available in computer science (try our mentor library to find short (<2min) videos and stories about different types of computer scientists).
