## Week 1 - The Beginning: An Introduction to Scratch & Computer Scientists
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week, start by introducing yourself and the field of computer science. If you are not a computer scientist, consider displaying one or two of the videos from the <a href="http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/computerscientistlibrary.html">computer scientist library</a>.

Then, get your students excited about programming by getting them started with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch programming</a>.

---

## Week 1 (continued) - Introductions (Role Modeling)

Time: 5 minutes

Introduce yourself. If you are a computer scientist, tell students how you got into computer science, why you like it, and a little bit about your other interests.

TIPS:
1. Avoid statements such as "I was good at math and science so I knew that computer science would be right for me." Stating that you were "good" at math and science implies that your ability was an intrinsic property rather than something you developed through practice and hard work. (Girls often feel that their abilities are implicit rather than something they can gain with through practice. <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/betterapproachestowellintentionedbutharmfulmessages_overcomingstereotypethreatimproveretention.pdf">Learn More</a>). 

2. Try to provide relatable interests (ice skating, soccer, etc.) so that the students can see themselves in your shoes one day.

3. If possible, try to describe multiple careers and eductional paths available in computer science (try our mentor library to find short (<2min) videos and stories about different types of computer scientists). Be sure to let the students know that computer science is valuable in all professions such as medicine, law, and journalism.

## Week 1 (continued) - Introduction to Scratch

Total Time: 55 minutes

1. Introduce students to the Scratch platform. Direct them to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu>scratch.mit.edu</a> and have them create an account.
2. Show them how to use Scratch by doing a quick example. Have a sprite move 10 units to the left. [Example code](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/21655719/)
3. Show the concept of a loop by repeatedly pressing the green flag. Now, show them how using an infinite loop leads to the same result. [Example code](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/21656115/)
4. Allow the students free time to create and explore the Scratch interface. If you have students who are more reticent, provide them with goal projects such as those listed on the next slide.

--- .class #id 

## Week 1 (continued) - Potential Goal Projects
1. Have the sprite move around the screen visiting each corner of the screen and changing colors when it reaches a corner. [Example of this project.](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/21656210/)
2. Have the sprite follow the mouse. [Example of this project.](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/21656523/)
3. Many [additional projects](http://scratch.mit.edu/explore/?date=this_month) are available on the Scratch website with source code visible.

--- .class #id 

## Week 2 - More Scratch & More Computer Scientists
Total Time: 60 mintues

This week will involve teaching students about conditionals in Scratch and gaining more exposure to "real" computer scientists from the computer scientist library.

--- .class #id 

## Week 2 (continued) - Presentations & Computer Scientist Library
Time: 5-10 minutes

0. Ask the students if they worked on any Scratch projects while they were at home, if they did, allow them to present their work to the class. 

Time: 5-10 minutes

1. This week, have students complete the "they're like me!" Computer Scientist Library scavenger hunt available [here](http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/teacher_resources.html#top) under Computer Scientist Library Projects & Assessments.

--- .class #id 

## Week 2 (continued) - Scratch Setup and Conditional Explaination
Time: 5 minutes

1. Place students in pairs, try to pair students at a similar level together, or in the case of a class with mixed ages, one student from each age group. Tell the pair that they must ask each other for help before asking you. Alternately, you can implement the "two before me" rule: require that students ask two classmates for help before approaching you.

Time: 5-10 minutes

1. The goal project for this week is creating sprites that chase each other and creating a playable piano. In order to complete these projects, students will need to understand conditional statements. 
2. One possible explaination of a conditional statement: "If it is raining outside, I need my umbrella, else, I do not need an umbrella."
3. Show students a Scratch based conditional statement example, such as one that "if the mousepointer is touching the sprite, the sprite is red, else the sprite is blue." State this sentance and then show the equivalent Scratch code.
4. Expect to need to re-explain conditionals to certain students one-on-one.

--- .class #id 

## Week 2 (continued) - Scratch Project Time
Time: 25-35 minutes

1. For students who are self driven: allow the open ended option to create "sprites that chase each other" and a "playable piano". For students who require more guidance, please see detailed goal project descriptions on the next slide.
2. At the end of the day, encourage students to work on Scratch projects on their own, let them know that they will be able to present in front of the class next time! (Consider having small prizes for those who do outside projects.) 

--- .class #id

## Week 2 (continued) - Potential Goal Projects
1. Ask students to create a <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2425970/">scratch piano</a>. For students that finish early, urge them to create a drum kit, trombone, and other instruments. 
2. Ask students to create "game" in which the cat follows the mouse and the dog chases after the cat, see our example <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20478118/">here</a>. Challenge students to turn this into a game by keeping score for every time the cat and dog collide. <a href="http://www.teach-ict.com/programming/scratch/scratch_home.htm">Idea credit.</a>
3. See <a href="http://www.teach-ict.com/programming/scratch/scratch_home.htm">here</a> for more scratch project ideas.

## Week 3 - More Scratch and an Introduction to Cryptology
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week will involve students designing and beginning to execute a big project in Scratch. 

We will also introduce students to the Pigpen Cipher and the concept of encoding and decoding messages.

--- .class #id 

## Week 3 (continued) - Presentations
Time: 5-10 minutes

1. Ask the students if they worked on any projects while they were at home, if they did, allow them to present their work to the class. 

--- .class #id

## Week 3 (continued) - The Pigpen Cipher
Time: 7 minutes

Explain the Pigpen Cipher (use <a href="http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/pigpencipher.html">this</a> page if you need help & to print out or display the cipher key) to students. Show them how to encode and decode two simple messages, <a href="http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/pigpencipher.html#example">for example</a>, "hello" and "goodbye".

--- .class #id

## Week 3 (continued) - Pigpen Cipher Telephone Game
Time: 7 minutes

Explain to students the following game:
<ol>
<li>You are going to sit in a line. </li>
<li>The right-most person in line will be given a message that is written in English, this person will encode the message to pigpen and pass the message to the person on their left.</li><li> The person on the left (person 2) will decode the message to English, and pass the message to the person on their left (person 3).</li> <li>Person 3 will encode the message to pigpen and pass the pigpen message to the person on their left (person 4). So on and so forth.</li><li> At the end of the line, we will determine whether the decoded message is what we originally sent!</li></ol> [To prevent boredom of those students waiting for a message, you may want to send a message from each end of the line on different colored paper.]

--- .class #id 

## Week 3 (continued) - Scratch
Time: 40-45 minutes

1. Work with each student to establish a plan for a "big project" give examples such as a short scene from a movie, the flappy bird game, the Pong game, the Space Invaders Game, etc. Walk students through what the different parts of their program might need to be, (e.g. for Pong: moving paddles, a bouncing ball, a scoring system). Links to example "solutions" for the projects listed are below:
2. If multiple students are interested in creating the same types of programs, you may want to group them together in the classroom so that they can ask each other for help.
3. Allow students to work on their big projects and tell them that you will be continuing work next week and will be presenting progress projects at the end of next class, but tell them they are definitely free to work on their own. Consider inviting special guests for the project presentations such as parents or another teacher or other students. You may also wish to offer gifts to each of the presenters (e.g. plastic sunglasses, or some other trinket). Further, you may wish to allow two weeks or class periods for students to work on projects depending on the size of your class and the interest level of the students.

## Week 4 - Final Scratch Presentations & An Introduction to the Internet
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week will be students' chance to present their "big" scratch projects that they worked on at the last 1-2 sessions. Try to bring in parents or fun rewards (cupcakes, sunglasses, magnets, etc.) for the presentations.

At the end of the session, students will watch a short introduction to the internet video and introduce the concept of HTML. 

--- .class #id 

## Week 4 (continued) - Final Scratch Presentations
Time: 50 minutes
Allow each student to come up to the projector and present their project. If you do not have access to a projector, have students gather around each other's computers.

--- .class #id 

## Week 4 (continued) - Introduction to the Internet
Time: 10 minutes
Show students this video:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHLr3vCfgNo&list=PLPpkJJSKXEJ11Mq8xjty3AZKldH9V48mt&index=2">Introduction to HTML</a>
& discuss any questions they might have. If you are not familiar with HTML you may want to read ahead in our <a href="http://mcwic.github.io/htmltutorial/">HTML Teacher Tutorial</a> and watch the full series of our [videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPpkJJSKXEJ11Mq8xjty3AZKldH9V48mt) first.

If you have extra time, direct students to the relevant web developer <a href="http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/blandrolemodellibrary.html">computer scientist profiles</a>: System Administrator & Web Developer & IBM Web Guru.

--- .class #id 

## Week 5 - Exploring and Creating HTML webpages
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week will be dedicated to students learning HTML and discovering their ability to create webpages.

Start off by showing students model webpages you may have created already or you found online. Then show them the code that created those webpages.
They have probably never seen code before. Talk through the code line by line, discussing which line of code corresponds to something they see on the page. 

Also try deleting part of the code and then running the page to see which, if any, errors occur, and how the web page looks without that piece of code.

--- .class #id 

## Week 5 (continued) - HTML Explained
Time: 10 minutes
Explain the HTML, head, body, heading, paragraph, image and hyperlink tags to your students. 

You can use the videos available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPpkJJSKXEJ11Mq8xjty3AZKldH9V48mt). 

Follow up with any additional explaination that you think will be helpful. 

--- .class #id 

## Week 5 (continued) - First Website: Goal Project 1
Time: 50 minutes

Show students the website images available [here](http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/htmlBuildingBlocks.html). Ask them to try to create the first website. Have students write their code in the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic">W3 try-it editor</a>. 

If you think your students will have trouble starting to write HTML code, have them write the code for the first goal website on paper. Go around the room to help them and identify errors. Alternately, you can pair students up and have them work on writing code on the computer together.

Common student errors include missing or mis-matched closing tags and forgetting the '/' in a closing tag.

Solutions to the goal websites are available [here](http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/teacher_resources.html#top).

## Week 6 - Reviewing HTML, learning CSS, and Creating webpages outside of w3
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week students will review HTML and create more complex webpages.

--- .class #id 

## Week 6 (continued) - HTML Review
Time: 10 minutes

1. Ask students about what they remember about HTML; if any students worked on html projects over the week, ask them to show their project to the class.

2. Have students write HTML code on the board (example script available <a href="">here</a>). If students make mistakes on the board, tell them where there is a bug. See if they can figure out and fix the bug without you telling them the specific error.

--- .class #id 

## Week 6 (continued) - New HTML & CSS Content
Time: 10 minutes

1. Show students the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXLIfufwmsE&list=PLPpkJJSKXEJ11Mq8xjty3AZKldH9V48mt&index=7) for creating lists in HTML and the collection of [CSS videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAChkbDdt4w&list=PLPpkJJSKXEJ11Mq8xjty3AZKldH9V48mt&index=8).

2. Give them each a sheet of paper (or ask them to come up to the whiteboard) and ask them to write the code they think they need to create a website with a purple heading and a blue background.

--- .class #id 

## Week 6 (continued) - Goal Project 2
Time: 40 minutes

1. The students will now move on to working on a goal project. (have them do this not on w3, but rather on their own text editor [click for more information](http://mcwic.github.io/htmltutorial/contents/start/)). 

2. Use goal projects 2 through 2c available [here](http://mcwic.github.io/htmlBuildingBlocks.html)

--- .class #id 

## Weeks 7 & 8 - Tumblr & Creating a Programming Portfolio
Students can apply their HTML and CSS learning by programming in Tumblr.

Walk your students through the Tumblr tutorial located [here](http://mcwic.github.io/tumblrtutorial/).

It will probably take two classes to work through this material. 

In week 7, we recommend walking through items 1-5. In week 8 we recommend working through items 6-9. Alternately, you can help your students create a programming portfolio in Tumblr during week 8, and leave items 6-9 for the students to work through on their own. 

Instructions on creating a programming portfolio in Tumblr are located [here]().
If you choose to have students create their own programming portfolio, you may also want to do the "Create Your Own Computer Scientist Profile" activity with them. Instructions and templates for this activity are available in the "Computer Scientist Library Projects & Assessments" section [here](http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/teacher_resources.html#top).
